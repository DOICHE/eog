=========== 0.11x.0 versions are for Gnome 2 ======================

Version 0.6
-----------

* There's a totally new Bonobo component which uses the core EOG
  code to display things (Martin, Michael). The old component has
  been moved into Nautilus.

* Requires Bonobo 0.35, GConf 0.12, gnome-print 0.25 and OAF 0.6.2.

Version 0.5
-----------

* You can now drag a bunch of filenames into a window and EOG will
  open them for you (patch from Juan Pablo Mendoza).

* Introduced a maximum zoom factor so that the gdk-pixbuf scaling
  functions are happy (Federico).

* Fixes to the documentation installation procedure (Federico).

Version 0.4
-----------

* Requires libglade stable and GConf 0.8.

* We now have a wonderful user's manual courtesy of Eliot Landrum.
  This guy deserves a beer.

* Greatly enhanced the scrolling engine.  Now it is fast and nice.  It
  also supports a two-pass scrolling mode which is useful for slow
  machines when scrolling zoomed images (Federico).

* New full screen viewing mode.  Look at your images on the big
  screen! (Federico)

* We support wheel mice; you can use the wheel for zooming (Federico).

* Windows can adjust their size and zoom factor automatically when
  opening new images (Federico).

* New preferences dialog and a slew of options to tinker
  with (Arik, Federico).

* The Bonobo part can now use OAF instead of GOAD (Maciej).

* Plenty of Bonobo work (Michael, Iain, Maciej).

* Miscellaneous UI polishing (Federico).

* New and updated translations (Fatih, Pablo, Rasta, Kjartan, Jesús,
  Zbigniew, Yukihiro, Christopher, Andreas, Jarkko, Valek, Gergo,
  Ville, Yuri, Kusano, Kenny, Kai, George, Matthias, Federico).

Version 0.3
-----------

* Requires gdk-pixbuf 0.7, gnome-print 0.18, bonobo > 0.9.

* The old canvas-based rendering engine is gone.  We now have a custom
  rendering engine using gdk-pixbuf's fast scaling functions (right
  now only bilinear interpolation is supported, but that will change).
  Zooming and scrolling can be interrupted by the user at any time,
  leading to a smoother user interface experience (Federico).

  Scrolling is not finished, look at the TODO list to see what is
  missing.  The final scrolling support will be in the next version.

* Image windows now display the filename and image size in the title
  (Miguel, Federico).

* Many enhancements to the Bonobo component (Michael).

* RGBA print support for the Bonobo component (Michael).

* We now install an eog.desktop file and a cool icon (Tuomas).

* Many new and updated translations (Ville, Jarkko, Pablo, Dan, Gergo,
  Alastair, Tomasz, Richard, Yuri, Matthias, Sergey, Fatih, Dennis,
  Christopher, George, Lauris, Vincent, Simos, Kjartan).

Version 0.2
-----------

* Requires gdk-pixbuf-0.3.  Uses the new gdk-pixbuf API.

* Added "hand" scrolling.  Performance sucks due to limitations in
  GtkLayout and the GNOME canvas.  These will be fixed shortly.


Version 0.1
-----------

This is the first public release of the Eye of Gnome.  It is *far*
from complete, but is stable and usable enough to work as a small and
fast image viewer.

Features in this release:

- Opening multiple images at once in different windows.

- Fast zooming and scrolling, while keeping memory usage constant.

- Opening multiple images from the command line.
