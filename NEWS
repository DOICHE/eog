Version 0.1

This is the first public release of the Eye of Gnome.  It is *far*
from complete, but is stable and usable enough to work as a small and
fast image viewer.

Features in this release:

- Opening multiple images at once in different windows.

- Fast zooming and scrolling, while keeping memory usage constant.

- Opening multiple images from the command line.
