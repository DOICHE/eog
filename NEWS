Version 0.3
-----------

* Requires gdk-pixbuf 0.7, gnome-print 0.18, bonobo > 0.9.

* The old canvas-based rendering engine is gone.  We now have a custom
  rendering engine using gdk-pixbuf's fast scaling functions (right
  now only bilinear interpolation is supported, but that will change).
  Zooming and scrolling can be interrupted by the user at any time,
  leading to a smoother user interface experience (Federico).

  Scrolling is not finished, look at the TODO list to see what is
  missing.  The final scrolling support will be in the next version.

* Image windows now display the filename and image size in the title
  (Miguel, Federico).

* Many enhancements to the Bonobo component (Michael).

* RGBA print support for the Bonobo component (Michael).

* We now install an eog.desktop file and a cool icon (Tuomas).

* Many new and updated translations (Ville, Jarkko, Pablo, Dan, Gergo,
  Alastair, Tomasz, Richard, Yuri, Matthias, Sergey, Fatih, Dennis,
  Christopher, George, Lauris, Vincent, Simos, Kjartan).

Version 0.2
-----------

* Requires gdk-pixbuf-0.3.  Uses the new gdk-pixbuf API.

* Added "hand" scrolling.  Performance sucks due to limitations in
  GtkLayout and the GNOME canvas.  These will be fixed shortly.


Version 0.1
-----------

This is the first public release of the Eye of Gnome.  It is *far*
from complete, but is stable and usable enough to work as a small and
fast image viewer.

Features in this release:

- Opening multiple images at once in different windows.

- Fast zooming and scrolling, while keeping memory usage constant.

- Opening multiple images from the command line.
