Hacking on the Eye of Gnome
===========================

I have tried to write the code in the Eye of Gnome with several goals
in mind:

	- It has to be maintainable.

	- It has to be extensible.

	- It has to be correct.

	- It has to be documented.

Being one of the authors of the GNOME Programming Guidelines, I have
tried to apply the principles mentioned there in the code for the Eye
of Gnome.  If you want to work on EOG as well, please read the GNOME
Programming Guidelines, understand their purpose, and keep them in
mind when writing code for EOG.

If you want to put code in EOG, I would like to review it first.
Please mail me a patch to <federico@gimp.org>.  This is to ensure that
the code fits well within the grand plan for EOG.  This is not
fascism, it is simple and innocent paranoia.

The reason for this is that EOG code base will grow to be
substantially big.  It will be a full product for image viewing and
cataloging; it is not "yet another image viewer".  I have to make sure
that the code will be able to sustain such work.
