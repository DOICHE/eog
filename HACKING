Hacking on the Eye of Gnome
===========================

o spec file: 
  People from the gnome packaging project are welcome to contribute fixes for
  the spec file.

o build fixes:
  "build sheriff commits welcome". Please send a mail with your patch to either 
  the maintainers or eog-list@gnome.org. If you don't know what "build sheriff"
  means please read the mail by Michael Meeks:

o In all other cases the following rules apply:

I have tried to write the code in the Eye of Gnome with several goals
in mind:

	- It has to be maintainable.

	- It has to be extensible.

	- It has to be correct.

	- It has to be documented.

Being one of the authors of the GNOME Programming Guidelines, I have
tried to apply the principles mentioned there in the code for the Eye
of Gnome.  If you want to work on EOG as well, please read the GNOME
Programming Guidelines, understand their purpose, and keep them in
mind when writing code for EOG.

If you want to put code in EOG, I would like to review it first.
Please mail me a patch to <federico@gnu.org>.  If you wish to commit
to the Bonobo component please send a patch to <mmeeks@gnu.org>.  This
is to ensure that the code fits well within the grand plan for EOG.
This is not fascism, it is simple and innocent paranoia.

The reason for this is that EOG code base will grow to be
substantially big.  It will be a full product for image viewing and
cataloging; it is not "yet another image viewer".  I have to make sure
that the code will be able to sustain such work.
