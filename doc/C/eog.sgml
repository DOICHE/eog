    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      &eog; is a program for viewing images and managing collections
      of images.  It does proper handling of large images, say,
      scanned posters at full resolution.  It supports full opacity or
      alpha channel information.  &eog; can zoom and scroll large
      images quickly while keeping memory usage constant.
    </para>

    <para>
      The functionality to work as a program for managing collections
      of images is not yet implemented as of version &appver;, but it
      is planned for the future.  The goal is for &eog; to become a
      useful tool for photographers and other people who have to
      maintain large collections of images in an organized fashion.

      <sect2 id="zooming-and-scrolling">
	<title>Zooming and Scrolling</title>

	<para>
	  One of the main features of &eog; as an image viewer is that
	  it lets you view very large images easily.  You can do this
	  by changing the zoom factor at which images are displayed
	  and by scrolling around the area of an image.
	</para>

	<para>
	  &eog; lets you change the zoom factor of an image in several
	  ways:

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		If you have a wheel mouse, you can simply use the
		wheel to quickly adjust the zoom factor.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		You can use the toolbar buttons as shown in <xref
		linkend="figure-image-window-toolbar">.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		You can press the <keycap>+</keycap> (plus) and
		<keycap>-</keycap> (minus) keys to increase and
		decrease the zoom factor, respectively.
	      </para>

	      <note>
		<para>
		  This only works on U.S. keyboards for now.  If you
		  know how to fix the code to support other keyboard
		  layouts, please email Federico at
		  <email>federico@gnu.org</email>.
		</para>
	      </note>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		You can press <keycap>1</keycap> to set the zoom
		factor to 1:1, or you can press <keycap>F</keycap> to
		fit the image to the window size.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		You can use the zooming commands in the
		<guimenu>View</guimenu> menu.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>
	  In addition, you can use the <guibutton>1:1</guibutton> or
	  <guibutton>Fit</guibutton> buttons in the toolbar to go back
	  to the original image's size or to make it fill the window,
	  respectively.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If an image is zoomed so that it does not fit in the window,
	  you can scroll it in several ways:

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		You can simply click on the image and drag it around.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		You can use the scrollbars with the mouse.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		You can use the arrow keys to pan the image.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</para>

	<para>
	  A wheel mouse is the most convenient way to navigate around
	  a large image, since you can zoom and drag the image using
	  only the mouse.  If you prefer the keyboard, you can use it
	  without having to use the mouse as well.

	    <para>
	      Normally you want to leave interpolation turned on,
	      because most photographic images look better that way.
	      You may want to turn it off if you are zooming into very

	      <title>Nearest neighbor</title>

	      <para>
		This means use no interpolation.  Pixels will be
		replicated for zooming in and you will see fat
		rectangles.  When zooming down, the image will lose a

	      <para>
		This a simple and very fast interpolation method.
		When zooming in, up to four adjacent pixels will be
		taken into account to compute the color of a new
		pixel.  When zooming out, regions of the original
		image will be averaged together to compute the colors
		of the new pixels.

	<!-- Dither type -->

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Dither type</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      This option specifies which dithering method to use.  In
	      &eog; dithering consists of simulating more colors than
	      your display can actually handle by clustering together
	      pixels of different colors in the hope that your brain
	      will do its thing and blend them together.  You may want
	      to turn on dithering if you are seeing color banding in
	      your images instead of smooth color transitions in the
	      shaded areas of your images.
	    </para>

	    <formalpara>
	      <title>None</title>

	      <para>
		This specifies no dithering, so &eog; will make every
		pixel be the closest color to the one in the original
		image.
	      </para>
	    </formalpara>

	    <formalpara>
	      <title>Normal (pseudocolor)</title>

	      <para>
		With this option set, dithering will only be performed
		on pseudocolor displays.  These are displays that use
		a limited palette of colors to display images, such as
		cheap or old video hardware with only 256 simultaneous
		colors.  If you have such a thing, well, you should
		really get a better display.  You have no idea of what
		you are missing.
	      </para>
	    </formalpara>

	    <formalpara>
	      <title>Maximum (high color)</title>

	      <para>
		This will perform dithering even on high color
		displays, even though they have a pretty good quality
		even without dithering.  High color displays are
		present in medium-end video hardware or many laptops
		that can display 65,536 simultaneous colors.

		<footnote>
		  <para>
		    Some even cheaper hardware can display only 32,768
		    colors.  To make sure, you just have to count
		    them.
		  </para>
		</footnote>

		This will make high-color displays be almost
		indistinguishable from a true color display (true
		color displays are the ones with millions of
		simultaneous colors.  If you are really neurotic and
		are dying to know, the exact number is 16,777,216).

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      &eog; has a nifty feature that can make scrolling look
	      faster when it really is not.  It can do this by drawing
	      the images in two steps:  the first step renders a
	      low-quality version of the image very quickly, and the
	      second step does a full-quality render.  The idea is
	      that you will get better visual continuity even though
	      the program cannot keep up with your obsessively-fast
	      scrolling; you will see the low-quality version almost
	      instantaneously and the high-quality version will
	      magically appear over the quick version.
	    </para>
