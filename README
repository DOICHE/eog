	-----------------------------------------------------


Perfect vision soup:

	- 1 cauldron of snake broth
	- 2 vampire ears
	- 4 legs of tarantula
	- 1 eye of gnome


Description
-----------

This is the Eye of Gnome, an image viewer program.  It is meant to be
a fast and functional image viewer as well as an image cataloging
program.


Requirements
------------

This package requires the following modules to be installed:
gnome-libs, gdk-pixbuf, Bonobo, gnome-print, GConf, gnome-vfs and libglade.

You can get these packages from your favorite GNOME FTP mirror at
http://download.gnome.org/GNOME/stable/sources or from other sources where 
GNOME packages are distributed.


Availability
------------

The bleeding-edge version of this package is always available from the GNOME
CVS repository (instructions at http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html).
Released versions are available at
http://download.gnome.org/GNOME/unstable/sources/eog.


Collection View
---------------

Since version 1.1.0 Eye of Gnome has rudimentary support for displaying image
collections and viewing diashows. Up to now this is an experimental feature,
which isn't well tested and has some known bugs/limitations. However, it is off
by default and must be enabled explicitly on compliation time with the
--enable-collection parameter.

By default, there isn't any caching mechanism for created thumbnails yet. But
you can install the optional helper library libpreview. With this library Eye
of Gnome is able to read and write thumbnails according to the Thumbnail
Management Standard. For more information see
http://triq.net/~pearl/libpreview.php. It is likely that this library
requirement will be dropped in future versions.


Reporting bugs
--------------
