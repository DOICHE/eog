================================================================

* Finish the ImageView widget:

	- Write a "fast" version of uta.c:uta_find_first_glom_rect().
	  Right now we just have a hacked version of libart's
	  function.

	- Figure out what to do with the color correction tables; we
          are not using them right now.

* Write the image category mechanism.

* Animation support:

	- Make the ImageView widget understand animations.  What to do
          about tearing when compositing the frames?  Should we
          special-case animations and blast them to the screen whole
          without tearing?

	  Maybe we can blast each frame at the proper time without
	  tearing, and only use the normal tearing method when the
	  user changes the zoom/scroll.

* Write the programmer's and API reference manuals.
